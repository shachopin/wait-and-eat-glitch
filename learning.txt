Installed Relic APM addon
according to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5480337/easy-way-to-prevent-heroku-idling


//both server will go idle, so sms cannot be sent
//for heroku, there is a way to prevent the dynmo from going idel
//http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5480337/easy-way-to-prevent-heroku-idling


// You can install the free New Relic add-on. It has an availability monitor feature that will ping your site twice per minute, thus preventing the dyno from idling.
// More or less the same solution as Jesse but maybe more integrated to Heroku... And with a few perks (performance monitoring is just great).
// install New Relic APM addon to your dawei-sms-server app on heroku https://elements.heroku.com/addons/newrelic

//Note: to all those saying it doesn't work: the important part in my answer is "availability monitor". Just installing the addon won't help. You also need to setup the availability monitoring with the URL of your heroku app.

//how to set the availability monitor:
